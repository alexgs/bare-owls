# Documentation

Generally, internal documentation should be stored as close to its subject matter as possible. For example, documentation about the product, code, design decisions, and so on should like in this repository. Documentation about milestones, sprints (e.g. retro reports), and so on should live in the project management software.

## Available Documentation

- Creating and managing [self-signed certificates](certificates.md)
- Configuring and starting the [database server](database.md)
- [Design decisions](design-decisions.md) about the product
- [Documentation and references](references.md) elsewhere on the interwebs
- [Old task IDs](old-task-ids.md) mapped to new IDs
